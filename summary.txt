Summary:
For lab 7 we were decoding a binary file of a boot sector.
We learned what the values mean at specific addresses,
the length of the values, and translating them from little to big endian.

For lab 8 we used the same information from lab 7 to get the basic information
of the bootsector and inspect the files and their information, such as their name,
file extension, attributes, date time, and size.  First we find the directory offset 
for the data.  (1 + (sectors per fat * Number of fats) ) * bytes per sector.
From that offset we read the 32 bits for each directory.
